# SUTD-SP SwiftUI Nano Academy AV System
## I had an idea at 1 AM

Look! An app that can manage the entire AV set up. I'm not entirely sure why I built this, but it was quite a good idea at 1 AM. Editing this at 8 AM, I'm not _entirely_ sure if it was worth the effort but it was quite funny.
- Welcome state that has a nice animating gradient, I guess.
- Connect Apple TV as source via HDMI capture card.
- Customizable Holding Slides.
- Timers
  - A nice animation for a count down timer that took surprisingly few lines of code.
  - Includes the radar sound to wake everyone up.
- Lunch state.
